# Deep Learning for LPBF IN738

Welcome to CreepData, a comprehensive platform developed by XUzhen. This repository houses the complete codebase and dataset, which are fundamental to our research endeavors.

The Deep Learning for LPBF IN738 project follows the MIT license.

In this project, we harness the power of deep learning techniques, including DNN (Deep Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), to predict the creep strain of LPBF IN738 high-temperature alloy over time.

Our model focuses on predicting strains within 8%. This makes it an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers looking to understand and predict the creep strain behavior of LPBF IN738 superalloy.

Feel free to explore the repository. We hope that our work aids in your research and understanding.
