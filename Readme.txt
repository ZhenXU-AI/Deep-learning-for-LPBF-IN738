# Deep Learning for LPBF IN738

Welcome to the Deep Learning for LPBF IN738 project. This repository provides the complete code and dataset necessary for our research.

In this project, we harness the power of deep learning techniques, including DNN (Deep Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), to predict the creep strain of LPBF IN738 high-temperature alloy over time.

Our model focuses on predicting strains within 8%. This makes it an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers looking to understand and predict the creep strain behavior of LPBF IN738 superalloy.

Feel free to explore the repository. We hope that our work aids in your research and understanding.
